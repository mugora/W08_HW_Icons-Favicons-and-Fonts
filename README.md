    Each page has a navigation bar that is the same
        The navigation should be on the right
        When at 600px or below in width, the navigation should change to a dropdown menu navigation. The dropdown icon should be a CSS Icon
            The dropdown menu should actually work, and be mobile friendly
            The text should be a unique font installed into your web page, but should not match any of the h1 fonts (See below)
    Each page should have a footer
        Using CSS Icons, link to three different social media websites. The Icon should match the link it takes the user to. It should only be the icon, no words should link the user to another page
        Icons should be shown horizontally, and change to vertical when 600px or lower in width
        Icons should be evenly spaced between each other vertically and horizontally
    Create a Three Page Website 
        There are three pages, Home About, Contact
        Each page should just have an H1 tag, identifying what page it is
            On each page, the font should be a unique readable font. Must be installed into your SASS/LESS Files
        Each page should have a unique favicon, identifying what content it is (So like a house for the Home page)
